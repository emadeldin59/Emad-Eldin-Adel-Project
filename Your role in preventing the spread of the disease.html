    <p><h1>Your role in preventing the spread of the disease
</h1></p>

    <p><big>Each individual must protect himself from infection by following the recommendations of the Ministry of Health, in addition to educating other people.

 I avoid being in crowded places or wearing a muzzle, I use tissues when coughing or sneezing, I also wash my hands frequently. I also advised all of my family members to follow the health guidelines.

The role of society in preventing the spread of the epidemic

 All members of society should follow healthy habits and cooperate with the government in fighting the disease and not crowding the supermarket. Do not purchase large quantities of food in order to store it.
